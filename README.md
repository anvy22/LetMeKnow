# Map-based Distance Alarm Application

Welcome to the Map-based Distance Alarm Application! This tool helps you stay on track by notifying you when you're getting close to a destination. It combines real-time location tracking, routing, and a distance-based alarm to keep you informed while on the move.

## What It Does

- Tracks Your Location: Uses your device's geolocation to keep track of where you are.
- Routes You to Your Destination: Provides a clear route from where you are to where you want to go.
- Alerts You: Plays an audio alarm and shows a notification when you're within a certain distance from your destination.

## How It Works

1. Map Initialization: The map is set up and centered on your current location.
2. Real-time Tracking: Your location is updated continuously on the map.
3. Destination Input: Enter your destination and the distance at which you'd like to be alerted.
4. Routing: The app calculates and displays the route from your current location to your destination.
5. Distance Monitoring: As you approach your destination, the app checks your distance and triggers an alert if you're within the specified range.

## Getting Started

1. Dependencies: This app relies on Leaflet.js and Leaflet Routing Machine, as well as OpenStreetMap tiles and Nominatim for geocoding.
2. Setup: Make sure you have a modern web browser that supports geolocation. Include Leaflet.js and Leaflet Routing Machine in your project and set up the necessary HTML elements for the map, form, and audio notifications.
